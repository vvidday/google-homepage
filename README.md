Google Homepage project from The Odin Project (Foundations).

Things I learnt from this project:
- Basic HTML and CSS (First time creating something from scratch)
- Using `:hover` selector to increase interactivity (underline links, border around buttons, highlight text input, etc)
- Creating a navbar / footer using an unordered list of anchor tags (remove `list-style-type`, use flexbox to display side-by-side)
